        <p>I travel regularly for both business and personal and have never had the type of service I experienced at this hotel. I believe they employ staff just to open doors and greet people. Service was incredible!!! This place is gorgeous, immaculately maintained, clean and first class. I was upgraded to a villa which was beyond beautiful. Heavenly place to relax!</p>

        <p>I have been very lucky to have stayed at Hotel KP several times for business and pleasure and I must say they have the "WOW" factor!  The rooms are amazing and comfortable, housekeeping very helpful. The few on-site restaurant that I've had the opportunity to visit have been very good and I just love the ambience and decor that the hotel has. Property feels very welcoming and intimate. I look forward to returning.</p>

          <p>Unmatched service, beautiful hotel, and convenience to the airport.  If you're willing to pay the price for excellence, I can't imagine a better place in the Dallas area to spend it. I was there for business, but the villa I stayed in was more than amazing. Quite large and very comfortable, plenty of room to work as well as relax.</p>
