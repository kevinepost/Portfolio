      <div class="testimonial background-primary">
        <p>The distinctive architecture of the Hotel KP offers a blend of classy contemporary and modern features. The spacious must-visit lobby, the grand staircase, ballroom, mezzanine, Veranda, the downstairs Grill Room, and all the public areas are a masterful work credited to a Dallas native James Williams.  He is just one of Texas premier designers of luxury Hotels.</p>

        <p>Construction began on The Hotel KP in 2004 with the help of the Hotel KP Board members, proudly led a civic campaign to raise $3,000,000 in financing through the sale of stock.  Downtown residents watched in awe as Dallasâ€™s sixth tallest building rose to a height of 35 stories.  No effort was spared to develop what has become known as one of Dallas, Texas must stay hotels. The 10 Private Pool Suite we have to offer has the following features: Private 22' Swimming Pool Heated to a Cozy 92 Degrees, Misting Steamroom, Relaxing Massage Chair, Cozy Fireplace, Soothing Whirlpool Tub, King Bed and much more.  All regular Guest rooms offer the same amenities without the Private 22' Swimming Pool.</p>

        <p>The Hotel KP has quickly established itself as a favorite for people needing to take a break and be pampered or if you need a venue to host a party/wedding/meeting.  In September 2009 Hotel KP added a Banquet Room, (2) Ballrooms, and (4) Board Rooms as part of a 18,000 sqft addition to the Hotel KP.</p>
